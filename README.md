This is a Node application that will perform 4 functions for you:

1) "my-tweets": displays my last 20 tweets
2) "spotify-this-song": place a song title after "spotify-this-song" and it will show you Spotify details about that track
3) "movie-this": place a movie title after "movie-this" and it will show you the OMDB details about that film
4) "do-what-it-says": this will run the command and value that is in a random.txt file

Enjoy!
